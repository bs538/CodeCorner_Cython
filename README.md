# CodeCorner Cython

This is an introduction about using Cython to optimize numerical Python code.

Written for the Code Corner series at the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge by Bjoern Soergel.

NB: The notebook rendered at Github does not deal with the "annotate" option of the Cython extension properly. Please download the notebook or look at the html version.
